### To start using mod go inside game and craft Blueprint Scroll (works as hammer)

### Features:
| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy to share            | All blueprint files are .yml files that are located in Config/Blueprints folder. You can also share / load blueprints via UI "Copy to clipboard" and "Paste from clipboard" buttons                                                                                                 |
| Other build mods support | Mod automatically supports .blueprint files as well as .vbuild files. If you use them there will be a button "Convert to Native" to convert file to .yml native Blueprint format                                                                                                    |
| Direct placement         | When placing blueprint (check UI screenshots) you place building directly. You would need all resources at once to do that so I highly recommend using any craft from containers mod so it can get resources from chests                                                            |
| Blueprint Box            | Mod adds a new build structure: Blueprint Box. Its a very large indestructible building where you can place all pieces for free (without functionality) and then save blueprint via interacting with table. Blueprint Box also allows you to "load" blueprint inside the box via UI |
| Smooth                   | Blueprint does all of its gameobject manipulations frame-by-frame so you shouldn't have a lot of FPS drops. If you have any then please increase frame skip and decrease objects-per-frame settings inside Menu->Settings->Blueprint vanilla ui window                              |
